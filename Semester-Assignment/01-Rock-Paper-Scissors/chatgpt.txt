Me Question: How to read a csv and manage it's content in a dictionary using python without using any libraries.

ChatGPT Answer:
To read a CSV file and manage its content in a dictionary using vanilla Python (without any additional libraries), you can use the built-in open function and string manipulation methods. Here's how to do it:

Example CSV (data.csv):
csv
Copy code
name,age,city
Alice,30,New York
Bob,25,Los Angeles
Charlie,35,Chicago
Code to Read CSV and Manage as Dictionary
python
Copy code
# Open the file and read the content
file_name = 'data.csv'
data = []

with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
    # Read all lines in the file
    lines = file.readlines()
    
    # Extract headers (first line)
    headers = lines[0].strip().split(',')
    
    # Iterate over the rest of the lines (data rows)
    for line in lines[1:]:
        values = line.strip().split(',')
        row = {headers[i]: values[i] for i in range(len(headers))}
        data.append(row)

# Print the resulting list of dictionaries
print(data)
Output:
python
Copy code
[
    {'name': 'Alice', 'age': '30', 'city': 'New York'},
    {'name': 'Bob', 'age': '25', 'city': 'Los Angeles'},
    {'name': 'Charlie', 'age': '35', 'city': 'Chicago'}
]
